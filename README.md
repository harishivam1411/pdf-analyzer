# Universal PDF Analyzer

A powerful web application to analyze, summarize, and chat with any PDF document. Built with FastAPI (backend) and Streamlit (frontend), this tool supports research papers, business reports, technical manuals, policy documents, books, and more. This project leverages OpenAI's language models for summarization and interactive chat, with ChromaDB for vector storage. It provides a seamless user experience to extract insights from documents and engage in meaningful conversations about their content.

## üöÄ Features

- **Smart Summarization:**
  - Upload any PDF and get a comprehensive, auto-detected summary.
  - Extracts key insights, findings, and adapts to document type.
- **Interactive Chat:**
  - Ask questions about your document and get detailed, context-aware answers.
  - Explore specific sections or topics interactively.
- **Multiple Export Options:**
  - Download results as Text, Markdown, or JSON.
- **Robust Error Handling:**
  - Handles timeouts, connection errors, and invalid responses gracefully.

VECTOR_PERSIST=True  # Set to True to enable persistent vector storage with ChromaDB, or False to use in-memory storage
```

### 5. Start the Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
uv run main.py
```

### 6. Start the Frontend (Streamlit)

```bash
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
